# Do you need to pin one or more posts at the top of a category on your WordPress site?

# There are plugins but they didn't work for me, the plugin "Category Sticky Post" only allows one pinned post per category and the plugin "Sticky Posts - Switch" doesn't work properly.

# I therefore suggest this piece of code to be placed in the functions.php of your theme.

# Simply for the posts you want to pin in their category, create a metadata with the name "mon_epingle" and the value "oui".

# It works!
